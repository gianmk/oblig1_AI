Firstly we choose to use regression and not classifier. This is because we are looking for exact values (that will vary from day to day. And not looking to classify the data together, f.eks only check if the stock-price are increasing or decreasing.  
We tried a handfull of different algorithms before chosing the random forest one.  
For example did the linear regression algorithm only give an accuracy-score of about 0,2. This makes sence as it is a straight line, while stock-prices can go up and down very fast.  
In the end we found that the random forest algorithm gave us the best results, so therefore was that our final choice.
